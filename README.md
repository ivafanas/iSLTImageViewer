# iSLTImageViewer
Yet another one image viewer for iOS.

# Description
The main idea is to be extra simple. No images downloading. No errors reporting. All of this is the responsibility of external code.

Just image viewing! And do it gracefully.
JTSImageViewController was used as initial implementation and significantly reduced with small number of bug fixes.

# Features
* View single image
* Scale images to zoom
* Dismiss by single tap or flicking away
